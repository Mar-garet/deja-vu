// A harness that compacts by rewriting its transcript leaves a file that opens
// with the summary and holds nothing before it. Continue does this: the session
// file goes from every turn to one summary item, and a pass that re-read it
// replaced the session's records with that one line, so every turn indexed
// before the compaction was gone from search (#4795). The file is the only copy
// Continue keeps, and it has no hook to run before the rewrite, so the records
// the index already holds are the only record of those turns left anywhere.
//
// So a re-read session whose file now opens with a summary keeps the records it
// had under that file and no longer holds. What the file still holds is read
// from it as before, so nothing is counted twice, and a second compaction keeps
// the first summary along with the turns after it.

// summary, the messages it holds as role and indexed text. raw says the texts
// have not been through indexedText yet.
