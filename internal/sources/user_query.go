// UserQuery returns what a person typed when a harness recorded the turn as
// its own context blocks followed by the prompt in a closing
// <user_query>…</user_query>. WorkBuddy's desktop app writes every prompt that
// way, behind two <system-reminder> blocks, so the whole record opened like a
// reminder and was dropped as plumbing (#4734).
//
// Only a text that opens with a tag and ends on the closing tag counts: a
// person's sentence that mentions <user_query> is left alone. With more than
// one pair the last is the prompt, the earlier ones being quoted context.
